I'm being asked to write a bit about myself, but I refuse as I would rather write about Bim. Bim is a foreign exchange student visiting Kyoto for the first time. Bim enjoys visiting Shijo-Ohashi, a bridge representative of Kyoto that crosses the Kamo river over Shijo street. It is also called Gion Bashi.
